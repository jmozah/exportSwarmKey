# exportSwarmKey

Currently it is a pain in the A** to export bee key in to metamask as they are not compatible.
This programe will export the private key so that people can import it in metamask or other wallets.


Usage: go run main.go \<sourceDirContainingBeeKeys\> \<password\>

Assumption: currently it assumes that you use the same password for all the keys in the dir :-)

Disclaimer: 
- This will display the private key so please do it in a safe place.
- There is absolutely no gurantee that your key will work or your fund security. 

** Please use at your own risk **
